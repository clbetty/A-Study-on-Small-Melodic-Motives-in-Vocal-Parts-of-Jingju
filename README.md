# A-Study-on-Small-Melodic-Motives-in-Vocal-Parts-of-Jingju

In recent years, there has been increased attention on computational approaches for studying music traditions from an ethnomusicological perspective, being jingju one significant case of study. Analyses about melodic characteristics of vocal parts in jingju have been the focus of many research works. In this study, we use the Jingju Music Scores Collection and music21 to extend the previous interval analyses by considering small melodic motives of three notes in vocal parts of jingju. The aim is to identify which pairs of consecutive intervals (considering interval class and direction) are more frequent in order to further characterize and understand this important music tradition. Specifically, for our analysis we attend to different \textit{shengqiang}, namely \textit{erhuang} and \textit{xipi}, and different role types, namely \textit{dan} and \textit{laosheng}; and confirm the existence of variations between these four categories in regards to small melodic motives of three notes. We present our results showing overall conclusions and differences between \textit{shengqiang} and role types, and finally end up with a discussion about the ethnomusicological implications of this study, as well as its limitations and future work.
